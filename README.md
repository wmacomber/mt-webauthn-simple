# mt-webauthn-simple

This is a proof-of-concept to show how webauthn can be integrated into a website.  I also treated it as an introduction to TypeScript for myself; I've been aware of TS for a long time, but I never had a real need to use it.  This gave me an excuse to play with it.

## Dependencies

What I wrote depends on MongoDB to store user and authenticator data.  Otherwise, it's just JS/TS.
